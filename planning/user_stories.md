## Problem Statement

We aim to create an online platform for food enthusiasts, food influencers, foodies and generally anyone looking for a recipe. Therefore our app will make it easier for food lovers around the world to connect, share recipes with one another and discover new recipes to love.

## User Roles

- Member has access to see saved recipes, adding comments and/or rating-
- Non-members cannot see the saved recipes page, add comments, or give ratings.


## User Personas

- (Member) Duy is an aspiring chef, and he lives in New York City. He is 35 years old and runs the “shake dinner”, a restaurant he inherited from his dad. He mainly uses his Samsung Laptop to access the internet, and uses our website about 3 times a week. He uses our website to find potential recipes to add to his menu, and he favorites all of the recipes he finds interesting using the account he registered on our website. Our website lucky has an interactive UI that is easy for Duy to use.

- (Member) Anthony is a 30 years old single dad from Florida who’s struggling to keep his young kids healthy. He mainly uses his PC and might be accessing the site multiple times a day to get new and appealing recipes for his kids. The website has an interactive sidebar with many different categories for Anthony to quickly filter his search results. He can also create a meal plan with saved recipes so he doesn’t have  to search for one each time. Additionally, he can choose to track the calories intake from the recipe to make sure his kids are really eating healthy. 

- (Non-member) Sassy is a junior college student from Illinois county university studying medicine. She is a member of the “alpha zeta omega” sorority, a campus organization at the ICU, that is planning a bake sale as a fundraiser event. She is a 21 yr old from southern california who uses her laptops for research, school assignments and event organizing. understanding that she is in charge of baking, she would like to make cookies, muffins and cupcakes but she has never baked a muffin before- only cookies and cupcakes. Sassy is color blind, therefore, she will have a hard time discerning between buttons.

- (Non-member) Duy, a seventh grade middle schooler in suburban Texas, recently heard a rumor that giving his crush a giant handmade heart shaped cookie will increase his chances of a successful confession. Duy uses the desktop at home to access the internet and browse resources. Duy would love to make his love confession as successful as possible, therefore he visited our website to discover the tools and knowledge he needs to make a heart shaped cookie. Duy is skeptical of the internet and new websites because he dislikes pop up ads.
