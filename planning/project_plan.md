## Problem Statement and Description

We aim to create an online platform for food enthusiasts, food influencers, foodies and generally anyone looking for a recipe. Therefore our app will make it easier for food lovers around the world to connect, share recipes with one another and discover new recipes to love. They can also choose to plan and track their meals to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 

## User Roles and Personas

- Member has access to see saved recipes, adding comments and/or rating. They can also track their calories and give feedbacks to the developers. 
- Non-members cannot see the saved recipes page, add comments, or give ratings. They can only look for recipes.
