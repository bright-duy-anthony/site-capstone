3. Allow users to leave a detailed review and response on a recipe
4. Each recipe has two scores. An aggregate user score and a score from us (any score that hasn't been calculated yet will be absent)
5. Ability to sort recipes based on tags like category, region, country, rating, etc.
6. Abilitt to create a recipe and update recipe details later on
7. Abillity to delete account

## Open Questions
