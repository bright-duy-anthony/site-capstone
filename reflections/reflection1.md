## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Getting the search functionality to work and finish up the backend. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Anthony and Nnaemeka: Burnt out, slowed down the work process near the end of the week.
 Duy: Extracting data and setting up the slider.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished all of the planned tasks for this week, in fact, we also finished some of the task for the next sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the labs and past projects were very helpful, especially with the backend side, we were able to set that up very quickly.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

None as of now, we believe that we can finish all of the listed features on time.
