# Reflection #2

Pod Members: **Anthony Martin, Nnaemeka Odedo, Duy Nguyen**


## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Upload image functionality, adding meal planner and searching up users.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Nnaemeka - Searching by recipe name when adding to meal planner
 Anthony - Formatting/styling issues
 Duy - Uploading image files (drag and drop functionality)

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes we finished our MVP and added some stretch features. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the labs and project also helped a lot in executing this week's sprint, especially the SQL lab, our backend query are becoming more complex for our functionality but we were still able to get it.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We listed leaving reivews under the recipes as "at risk" but that will change since we were able to finish our MVP this week.
