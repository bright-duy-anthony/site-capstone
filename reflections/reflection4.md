 Add response here

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Challenges includes deciding what are the most important thing we want to show the user on mobile devices, took a lot of effort to fit the website on a mobile screen while keeping all of the features.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes we finished all of our tasks not only for this sprint but also next sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 For this week the resources didn't prepare us in executing our capstone sprint, however it did help us know where to look for hint. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We were able to finish all of our listed features.
