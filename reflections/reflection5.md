## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 
 
The pacing of our capstone project is just right, we didn't have to spend too much time working after hours to finish it.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?
    
The plan didn't change much over the course of development, however, there were some modification on the features we wanted to have orginally, we reduced some and stretched some features for those features to be doable.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
    
The labs and weekly assignment were extremely helpful, especially the backend. The way the backend is setup is not too different between projects so we were able to knock out the backend functionality on the first week of working. A topic that we still have questions about is about creating a permission middleware that accounts for if user have access to another user's data.

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
    
The mentors and the wireframes were the most helpful. The mentors were able to help us scope our features to make sure it's achievable, like we had to simplify one of the feature to make sure we can do it while keeping the main purpose of the features. The wireframes are very helpful for the frontend, it helps us setup the components and the bare bone of the frontend side very quickly, so we can have more time to focus on the styling. The practice demo days were also very helpful, not only it prepare us for the final demo day, we also receive a lot of good feed back from the instructors and the TAs to take our project a step further, so shoutout to them as well.
